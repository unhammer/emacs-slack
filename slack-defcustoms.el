;; Container of shared variables for emacs-slack

;; A common place to store shared variables.
;; Possibly the container of all defcustom but no time to refactor things at the moment.

;;; Code:

(defcustom slack-extra-subscribed-channels nil
  "A list of channel names you want to be subscribed.
These are added to the check on team's :subscribed-channels"
  :type 'list
  :group 'slack)

(defcustom slack-update-quick nil
  "Set to t if you hit rate limiting on connection.

Slack has strict rate limiting for user tokens. Updating public
channels can hit these limits pretty quickly if the Slack team is
large enough. Setting this to t, will make sure only channels you
are part of are updated via `slack-api-client-userboot-url'.

The cons of this approach is that you will need to explicitly
call `slack-conversations-list' if you want a sync of public
channels. You may need that if you don't find a channel you
expect to exist."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'slack)

(defcustom slack-open-message-with-browser t
  "Opens message permalink in browser if it cannot be opened in a message buffer.

So far (2024-10-29), emacs-slack doesn't support jumping on an old message for a channel:
it just loads the latest messages in a channel.
Ideally we want to have that, but for now we let the user jump to Slack app or web app to check the contents."
  :type 'boolean
